## About FABER

FABER (Fatigue Benchmark Repository) is a COST Action CA23109 initiative dedicated to advancing the field of fatigue analysis through open science and collaborative research. We aim to create comprehensive repositories of experimental data, computational tools, and standardized benchmarks to improve fatigue life prediction methods.

## Mission

Our mission is to bridge the gap between academia, industry, and software developers to foster better and safer design methodologies. We focus on:

- 🔬 **Open Science**: Creating open-access repositories for experimental fatigue data
- 🤝 **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Promoting cooperation among researchers, industry professionals, and software developers
- 🛠️ **Tool Development**: Developing open-source fatigue analysis software
- 📊 **Standardization**: Providing easily accessible benchmark data sets for testing prediction hypotheses and computational tools
- 🎯 **Safety & Efficiency**: Improving engineering practices to enhance safety and cost-effectiveness

## Objectives

1. **Reduce Fragmentation**: Create a central resource that fosters better data sharing and standardized practices in fatigue research
2. **Enhance Prediction Methods**: Improve the accuracy and reliability of fatigue solver software
3. **Foster Collaboration**: Build a community of researchers and practitioners working together on fatigue-related challenges
4. **Promote Transparency**: Encourage responsible use of computational results through open-source initiatives
