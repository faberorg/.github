## About FABER

FABER (Fatigue Benchmark Repository) is a COST Action CA23109 initiative dedicated to advancing the field of fatigue analysis through open science and collaborative research. We aim to create comprehensive repositories of experimental data, computational tools, and standardized benchmarks to improve fatigue life prediction methods.

## Mission & Objectives

Our mission is to bridge the gap between academia, industry, and software developers to foster better and safer design methodologies.

- 🔬 **Open Science & Data Access**: Create open-access repositories for experimental fatigue data and benchmark datasets to reduce fragmentation and improve standardization.
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Promote cooperation among researchers, industry professionals, and software developers; build a community working together on fatigue-related challenges.
- 🛠️ **Tool Development**: Develop open-source fatigue analysis software to enhance prediction methods and support reproducible workflows.
- 📊 **Standardization**: Provide accessible benchmark datasets for testing prediction hypotheses and computational tools, encouraging comparable and transparent results.
- 🎯 **Safety & Efficiency**: Improve engineering practices to enhance safety and cost-effectiveness, and encourage responsible, open use of computational results.
